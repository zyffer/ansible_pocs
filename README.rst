Ansible PoCs
============

In its quest for simplicity, Ansible created a model that can often lead

are less intuitive and not well documented.  The goal is to demonstrate
principles of Ansible in order to enable a better understanding of the
tool, and in turn, better quality of reusable artifacts.
